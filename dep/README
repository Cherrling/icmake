The class Dependencies is the workhorse class.

Its constructor determines the parser- and scanner-dirs from the icmconf file,
Next it adds all directory names from CLASSES to the d_directory string
vector, so that each directory name is stored only once. 

Once all directories have been determined there are size = d_directory.size()
directory names.

The matrix d_dependency is a bool-matrix of dimension size x size. If
element[r][c] is true then class [c] depends on (= includes) class[r]. The
the function 'dependsOn' determines these dependencies.
