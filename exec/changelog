icm-exec version 10.00.00

  * C++ version of icm-exec

  * As with flexc++ canonical paths are not used anymore. Instead
    absolute paths are used (builtin/chdir.cc)

  * Added option -n: drops the requirement that icm-exec and the bim file to
    unassemble must have identical main version numbers.
