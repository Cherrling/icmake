icm-pp version 10.00.00

  * As with flexc++ canonical paths are not used anymore. Instead
    absolute paths are used.

  * icm-pp doesn't use a parser: removed from the source tree

  * the test/ directory contains various icmake scripts which can be
    preprocessed by icm-pp. It also contains example .pim files which may be
    used for regression testing
