Icmake's programs are C++ programs since version 10.00.00.  Valentin Lefebvre
noticed that in order to build icmake the bobcat library must be available,
but icmake is used to construct the bobcat library. If neither icmake nor
bobcat is available a bootstrapping procedure must be used. For this the
'bobcatbootstrap' script can be used. See README.bobcatbootstrap for details.


If the bobcat library is already installed then the following procedure can be
used to build the icmake programs:


0. After unpacking the icmake_XX.YY.ZZ.tar.gz icmake archive, make your
   current working directory equal to the directory in which you found this
   file. 

1. Inspect and modify if necessary the current locations in INSTALL.im.

2. If you want the compiler to insert debugging code in the icmake programs
   then define a CXXFLAGS environment variable. E.g., 

                CXXFLAGS="--std=c++20 -Wall -O2 -g"

3. To prepare for the compilations of the programs, run 

                ./icm_prepare /

3. Compile the various programs (x is a dummy argument required by
   ./icm_bootstrap to run):

                ./icm_bootstrap x

4. As root: install the programs and documentation:

                ./icm_install strip all

   (the elements of the installation are under tmp/etc and tmp/usr)

    For debian, the following install commands are issued, installing under 
    debian/icmake and debian/icmake-doc

        ./icm_install strip progs debian/icmake
        ./icm_install scripts debian/icmake
        ./icm_install skel debian/icmake
        ./icm_install man debian/icmake
        ./icm_install doc debian/icmake
        ./icm_install etc debian/icmake
        ./icm_install docdoc debian/icmake-doc

                    
5. Remove intermediate construction area:
                rm -rf tmp


Following these commands (referring to the #defines in INSTALL.im):
    
    icmake is in /BINDIR
    skeleton files, installed by icmstart, are in /SKELDIR
    manual pages are in /MANDIR/man{1,7}
    icmake support programs are in /LIBDIR
    confguration files, specifying which skeleton commands to install, are in
        /CONFDIR
    icmake documentation is installed in /DOCDIR and /DOCDOCDIR
