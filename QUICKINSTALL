Preamble:
=========

Icmake's programs are C++ programs since version 10.00.00.  Valentin Lefebvre
noticed that in order to build icmake the bobcat library must be
available. Since icmake 12.00.00 that dependency has been removed.

Initial installation of icmake from its sources:
================================================

0. After unpacking the icmake_XX.YY.ZZ.tar.gz icmake archive, make your
   current working directory equal to the directory in which you found this
   file. 

1. Inspect and if necessary modify the current location specifications in
   INSTALL.im. These locations specify where the icmake components (binaries,
   man-pages, etc.) will eventually be installed.

2. If you want the compiler to insert debugging code in the icmake programs
   then the required options can be defined in the ICMAKE_CPPSTD  environment
   variable. E.g.,  

                ICMAKE_CPPSTD="--std=c++23 -g"

   By default the -g flag is not specified

3. Prepare the construction of the icmake software:

                ./prepare /

   where the argument / defines the root directory below which icmake's files
   will be installed (by install, see 6).

4. Construct libicmake.a:

                ./buildlib /

5. Construct the icmake programs:

                ./build all

6. Install the programs:

                ./install strip all

   The argument 'strip' is optional. When specified icmake's binaries will be
   stripped before being installed. 

7. Remove the intermediate construction directory:
                ./clean

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The above steps install the icmake software under the directory specified as
./prepare's argument (cf. step 3; capital directory names refer to the
#defines in INSTALL.im). When specifying / as icm_prepare's argument the
following elements are installed by ./install all:
    
    icmake is in /BINDIR
    skeleton files, installed by icmstart, are in /SKELDIR
    manual pages are in /MANDIR/man{1,7}
    icmake support programs are in /LIBDIR
    confguration files, specifying which skeleton commands to install, 
        are in /CONFDIR
    additional icmake documentation is installed in /DOCDIR
